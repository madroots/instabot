# instabot.sh

Instagram bot. Follow, unfollow and more. 

Before start, edit "cas" variable at the beginning of the script - add how many seconds wait between follows (number)

Safe vaule would be 150 - 240 (bot will follow someone every 240 seconds, for example which makes 15 people/hour)

Higher values are dangerous.
